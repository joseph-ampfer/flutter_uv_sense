## üìò Assignment 2 (5 pts)

**Write requirements**

- [x] Decided AI option  
option 2
- [x] Defined features (problem, importance, solution)  
  - List features here:  
    1. UV Sensor Integration

      * Problem: Users lack accurate, real-time UV exposure data tailored to their location and activity.
      * Importance: Generic weather apps give rough UV indices, but not precise readings‚Äîespecially with shade, clouds, and micro-environments. Personalized data helps prevent over/under exposure.
      * Solution: Use an ESP32 with UV sensor to gather real-time readings and connect to the Flutter app via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi.

    2. UV Tracking App

      * Problem: People don‚Äôt track their cumulative daily/weekly UV exposure.
      * Importance: Overexposure increases risk of skin cancer and aging, while underexposure leads to vitamin D deficiency.
      * Solution: Build a Flutter app that logs UV data, displays trends, and visualizes safe vs unsafe exposure ranges.

    3. User Sensitivity Quiz

      * Problem: UV tolerance varies by skin type, genetics, and lifestyle, but most apps give ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù advice.
      * Importance: Personalized recommendations reduce risk and increase user trust in the app.
      * Solution: Create a short quiz to assess user‚Äôs UV sensitivity (based on dermatology research such as Fitzpatrick skin type).

    4. Recommendation Engine

      * Problem: Users need actionable advice, not just numbers.
      * Importance: Showing a UV index of ‚Äú7‚Äù means little unless the user knows how to respond.
      * Solution: Build a recommendation table (time to stay outside, need for sunscreen, vitamin D goals, shade advice) based on quiz results + live sensor data.

    5. UI/UX Flow & Visualization

      * Problem: Poorly designed apps discourage usage and fail to deliver insights.
      * Importance: A clean interface ensures users actually use the app daily.
      * Solution: Sketch a flow (sensor connect ‚Üí dashboard ‚Üí quiz ‚Üí recommendations ‚Üí history logs). Build Flutter UI screens to support it.

      * Local database (SQLite or Hive) to store logs
      * Graphing/visualization package (charts\_flutter, fl\_chart)
      * Background service to auto-log readings

    3. For User Sensitivity Quiz

      * Research Fitzpatrick skin type and UV sensitivity questionnaires

      * Scoring algorithm to classify user type
      * Store results linked to user profile

    4. For Recommendation Engine

      * Build a recommendation table (matrix of skin type √ó UV index ranges)
      * Logic to merge sensor data + quiz results
      * Flutter logic to display advice dynamically
      * Handle edge cases (low UV, night, indoors)

    5. For UI/UX Flow & Visualization

      * Wireframe sketches for app flow
      * Flutter UI screens: login/intro ‚Üí connect sensor ‚Üí dashboard ‚Üí quiz ‚Üí recommendations ‚Üí history
      * Consistent theme/colors for clarity
      * Testing with mock data before connecting sensor

### Your Individual Project Feature/Requirements Count

It is possible to change the features/requirements if you encounter ‚Äúunknown unknowns,‚Äù with explanation.

1. Number of individual features: ( __5_ )  
2. Number of individual requirements: ( __20_ )

### Your Individual Project Features

- What is the problem?  
UV radiation changes with shade, clouds, and time of day. This app will give you pinpoint precision and reccomendations.
- Why is it important?  
Many people care about their skin, and UV radiation is a huge factor. Some people don't get enough for vitamin D, leading to depression and low bone density. Others get too much sun, leading to wrinkles and cancer.
- How will you solve it (including the design)?  
I will build a Flutter app that connects to an ESP32 IoT UV sensor to provide real-time UV data. The app will:

Connect to the sensor via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi

Track and log daily/weekly UV exposure

Include a quiz to determine user UV sensitivity (based on skin type research)

Use a recommendation engine to suggest actions (safe exposure time, sunscreen, shade, vitamin D advice)

Present information with a clear UI flow: sensor connect ‚Üí dashboard with live UV readings ‚Üí sensitivity quiz ‚Üí personalized recommendations ‚Üí history log with graphs.
